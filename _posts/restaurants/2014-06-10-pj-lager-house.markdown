  <p>
     PJ has brought back the kitchen with Detroit Attitude and a dash of New Orleans flavor.
     Hamburgers are handmade from fresh, ground steak. The salad dressings are made from scratch.
     Veggie burgers are made from house made falafel.
     The gumbo is the real thing. Food lovers of all stripes will find fresh fare.
