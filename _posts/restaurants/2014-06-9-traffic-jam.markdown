In terms of d√©cor, Traffic Jame and Snug is like the Cracker Barrel of Detroit.
The vibe is really pleasant, and the place is huge!
They have a bakery that has a "bread of the day", and the brew their own beer.
Most importantly, it seems like the servers are informed about what vegan means.
They have a list of things they can show you that you would be able to get.

Just a few vegan options you have there (some have to be modified):
<ul>
  <li>Vegan dressings: dijon, citrus, balsamic, vinegar & oil</li>
  <li>Yekik Alicha (Ethiopian split peas) </li>
  <li>Cherry pecan salad</li>
  <li>Burritos</li>
  <li>Tex Mex Lentil Burgers</li>
  <li>Fries are dairy free, and the fryers use soybean oil.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    The Traffic Jam and Snug, established 1965, is truly one of Detroit's hidden
     treasures. Known throughout Midtown for our in-house bakery, microbrewery,
     and dairy, our curiously intimate multi-level dining rooms, and an eclectic
      menu of made-from-scratch dishes, there is simply nothing quite like The Traffic Jam.
